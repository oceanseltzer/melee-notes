- in general I think that you and I tend to play very similar in teams, which leads to us going for the same thing and letting people get away with stuff. we both play more "backline," i.e. finding opportunities over creating openings. so we should establish a gameplan in neutral such as you always take the lead, I always take the lead, or whoever is in front takes the lead. we can talk about this in more detail. admittedly this more of an issue with fox+falcon than fox+peach, but it's still there a bit.

- since peach is so slow (especially vertically) I can only team combo if you knock them in my direction. what this means is that if you upair them, unless I'm already in position, there's no way I can get there in time. generally you should bair / nair them towards me if you want to build percent, and uair when they're at kill percent. also since peach isn't good at killing from the middle of the stage, it makes the most sense for you to be the finisher for on stage combos. thus I'll always be looking to knock them back towards you, unless I can setup an edgeguard.

- when you come off the respawn platform, you tend to run to wherever I am and throw out hitboxes. when you have invincibility and I don't, it's best to leave me alone and use that time to separate the opponents. if they're both on me, try to poke without coming into the space and look for stay hits to convert off of.

- unless I'm actively getting hit, always try to recover, even if you won't make it. peach is so good at saving (and it's one of my stronger skills) that we can get a lot more life out of your stocks this way, especially since fox is so good at getting to ledge and getting off ledge.

- peach doesn't need help getting out of shield. characters like falcon and marth do need help, but peach has nair and up-b so you can give me room when I'm in shield. let me punish them oos, and be looking to convert off of reversal hits.

- we need to be more practiced at hitting out of grabs. speed is really the key here unless it's a pure 2v1, so I think stick with upsmash and bair out of my grab. upsmash I won't be able to follow up on directly, but I can position myself to convert off your next hit if you bair them in my direction. you can also bair out of my grab to setup an edgeguard situation if I've got them near the ledge, which is a really strong option. during 2v1s we can focus more on percent building, like dair and utilt. out of your grab, I'll be looking to either nair or dsmash. nair you should be able to follow up on since it breaks grab immediately, and dsmash is good at setting up edgeguards.
